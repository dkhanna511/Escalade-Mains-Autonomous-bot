# Escalade-mains-autonomous-bot

The code consists of an algorithm which has been used in Escalade Mains in IIT Guwahati.
The materials used for the bot are:
BO Motors, Sensors, Arduino Mega.  

Sensors used for the project are : color  sensor, ultrasonic sensor, IR sensor, sharp sensor.

The problem statement is for making a line followere robot which is used to follow a line and is able to recognise different colous in between. The bot should also be used tp recognise any obstacle while following a black line and is able to dodge the line and track the line again.

IR sensors are used to follow the black line.
Color sensors are used to track various coloured checkoints at which the bot has to perform tasks like waiting , picking up a block, dropping down a block, choosing which line to follow afterwards( when there is intersection)

The bot consists of three ultrasonic sensors which are used to sense if the obstacle in front or sideways while tracking the black line.
